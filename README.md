# Thermal-face-recognition-using-transfer-learning
In this project, I introduce a thermal face recognition method based on convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that the transfer learning approach is applied in the classification of facial thermograms.
In order to implement my proposal, I used the VGG16 architecture, which was previously presented in the following research paper:

The facial thermal images utilized in the present project, come from the Terravic Facial IR Database, a benchmark collection that can be found at http://vcipl-okstate.org/pbvs/bench/
